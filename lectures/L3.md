## Syntax

When we speak about syntax in LPT we mean string manipulation.

```java
p ⋀ q ≠ q ⋀ p
```

The example above shows that the two expressions are not equal since the order is important (however, later on in the course this will be proven that they are in fact equal).

## Language proposition

### Alphabet
```java
𝞂  - an amount of symbols
𝞂 = {p0, p1, p2, ...} // the typical amount
𝞂 = {p, r, q} // define it as you want
```
Each choice of ```𝞂``` sets an accent of the language, ```LP(𝞂)```.

- All symbols in 𝞂
- All connectives
- Parentheses

### Expression
With an expression we mean a string.
```p0 ⋀ p2```, ```p1 ⋀ ¬``` and ```((¬p1) ⋀ p2)``` are examples of expressions.

### Definition of formulas
- Base: ```⊥``` is a formula. Each symbol in 𝞂 is a formula.
- Induction(¬): if ```𝞅``` is a formula, then ```¬𝞅``` is also a formula.
- Induction(⋀, ⋁, →, ↔): If ```𝞅``` and ```ⲯ``` are formulas, then ```(𝞅 ◻ ⲯ)``` is also a formula where ```◻ ∈ {⋀, ⋁, →, ↔}```.
- **Nothing else** is a formula.

```⊥```, ```(¬⊥)``` and ```(p0 ⋀ (¬p1))``` are examples of formulas.

### Parantheses convention
- ```¬``` bind stronger than all other connectives.
- ```⋀``` and ```⋁``` bind stronger than ```→``` and ```↔```.

### Parsing tree for formulas

## Rules for ↔ (equivalent)

#### Introduction
```java
 𝞅 → ⲯ       ⲯ → 𝞅
------------------- ↔I
       𝞅 ↔ ⲯ 
```

#### Elimination
```java
 𝞅 ↔ ⲯ         𝞅 ↔ ⲯ
------- ↔E    ------- ↔E
 𝞅 → ⲯ         ⲯ → 𝞅
```

## Examples

### #1

#### Question
Solve: ```p ⋀ q ⊢ q ⋀ p```

#### Answer
```java
 p ⋀ q         p ⋀ q
------- ⋀E    ------- ⋀E
   q             p
--------------------- ⋀I
        q ⋀ p
```
