### Rules for ⋀ (and)

#### Introduction
```java
 𝞅       ⲯ
----------- ⋀I
    𝞅⋀ⲯ
```

#### Elimination
```java
 𝞅       ⲯ         𝞅       ⲯ
----------- ⋀E    ----------- ⋀E
     𝞅                 ⲯ
```

### Rules for ⋁ (or)

#### Introduction
```java
     𝞅                 ⲯ
----------- ⋁I    ----------- ⋁I
    𝞅⋁ⲯ               𝞅⋁ⲯ
```

#### Elimination
```java
           𝞅 (1)   ⲯ (2)
           .       .
           .       .
 𝞅⋁ⲯ       𝞂       𝞂
--------------------- ⋁E (1, 2)
           𝞂
```
